# Important files -

All are important except - **test_images** , **analysis.m** , **analysis2.m**, **Demo.m**.

# Run the algo -

- Open **Demo_real.m** and run it.
   -  In this **WSNM_Denoising** is the main implementation of the algorithm, all other function file uses can be found in that file.

   - **Obj_func** is the extra function file which show the value of objective function per iteration value as described in  paper.

- All the setting in this method is same as **WNNM** Algorithm.
