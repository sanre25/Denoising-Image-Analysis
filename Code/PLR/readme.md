# Important files 
- In this algo implementation the only important function file is **plr** which take *noisy image* and *sigma* level of noise as input and gives output. Also this method optimization problem solution is found in explicit form. No iteration is used in this ALGORITHM.

- Ignore the **demo** file which is little bit confusing.

- **test_images** and **analysis** files are for experiment purpose only.

# Run the files

- To test this method open **my_rough** file and give image as a input. 

- **my_rough** and **plr** is suffcient files for the testing.
